I'm a web developer with technical training and a strong self-taught mindset. Through my studies and personal projects, I've learned to build clean, functional, and accessible interfaces, paying close attention to both structure and visual clarity.

I'm especially interested in automation, modular code organization, and designing systems that are clear, sustainable, and easy to maintain. I enjoy working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I strive to apply best practices at every stage of development.
